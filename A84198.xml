            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:123812:2"/> ſome delight either in the whiteneſſe of the paper, or in the manner of the infolding of the letter, firſt tooke it into one hand and gazed upon it, and then into another, and according to the naturall expreſſions of that creature, ſhee ſéemed by the noyſe ſhe made to be very joyous of it, &amp; did much hugg the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. At length weary of what ſhe ſéemed ſo much to affect and full of miſchiefe, as of haughtineſſe, ſhe took the letter and tore it all in peices, which the Country man beholding thought within himſelf, that in diſdayne of his ſonnes letter ſhe had made a Taylers bill of it, and torne it to flitters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of diſcharging it: at laſt when he underſtood that it was Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Munkey, he went home and told his ſon that his Miſtres was neither better nor worſe, but a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Munkey, for I wil ſwear quoth he that I never ſaw ſuch a ſtrange faſhioned creature in my life; For ſhe hath a kind of a Round-head as ſmooth as an apple, and if there be any Round-head this Munkey is one, her brow is low and wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hanging over her little eyes, her noſe thats flatt is very ſhort, her cheekes are leane and lanke, and her thin lipps do hardly cover her teeth, the complextion of her whole face is ſwarthy coverd with hayre greene as moſſe, and laſtly ſhe hides her head in a black bagg, moreover ſhe weares a greene or yellow gowne trimmed about with lace, &amp; a girdle about her middle by the which ſhe is faſtned to the na<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I remember in my youthfull dayes when I danced with the country Laſſes on the towne greene, I had the happineſſe to view ſome of there commodityes, and they lookt juſt like Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Munkeys mouth, or as an ancient author ſayes, like mumping things; and ſo her honeſty I beléeve tis aſmuch as nothing, for like the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhe keepes her taile alwayes wagging, and being her own (as the whore ſaid) ſhe thinks ſhe may uſe it as ſhe liſt, ſo that I beléeve ſhe is a very wicked and prophane Munkey, Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Dog who had bewitched the Country mans ſon to beléeve that Prince <hi>Rup<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <div type="part">
               <head>What ſhe doth figuratively ſignifie.</head>
               <p>A Monkey for her petulant and wanton tricks may reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle a wanton creature, I will not ſay a whore (for that name will make the Devill bluſh) but a neceſſary inſtrument of recreation, unto which pretty peeces of delight it is no doubt but Prince <hi>Robert</hi> doth ſtand well affected, and though a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, he doth love the ſoft embraces of a faire laid, ſince <hi>Mars</hi> himſelf did ſcorne to dally with <hi>Venus, Eneas</hi> had a <hi>Dido,</hi> and it is like that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> is not onely a ſouldier but a courtier, it being naturall to the moſt witty and valiant to love a woman. But let that paſſe, certaine it is that the Prince doth love this Monkey exceedingly; and the Monkey doth by all her geſtures and actions tempt the prince to laſſiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſires, and if a puritan ſhould behold her he would verily affirme that ſhe were the little whore of Babylon, for indeed ſhe ſpeakes nothing but the language of the beaſt. When the prince is in ſight, ſhe will caſt a ſleering looke towards him, then throw her little eyes another way, then looke upon the prince again, then which as if ſhe would tempt him to give her a private meeting, which are all laſcivious tricks, and ſome time ſhe affords a temptation to the prince by clapping her hand on her buttock and ſcratching it as if ſhe were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the luſtfull itch, whereby perhaps ſhe makes the prince thinke of another buttock, ſo that luſtfull pictures or a wr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 chunk">

Some times ſhe will imitate the ſitting of women by the fire ſide on a low ſtool, with her knées up to her mouth, and her hands faſtned about her knees, a pre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:123812:3"/> Then again ſhe will look melancolly as if ſhe were a ſad wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow mourning in a black bag for the deceaſe of her huſband, though indeed ſorrow cannot drawe a teare from her working eyes, &amp; then ſhe wil appeare like a holy ſiſter, caſting her eyes, with a ſilent gleg upwards, but preſently her devotions are ended, if ſhe behold but a red ſided Apple, for ſhe loves them better then Religion or libertye of the Subject. Then you ſhall behold her tumbling on her back with her legs ſpred wide abroad, and it is thought that ſome women have learnt their tumbling tricks from Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Monkey, ſhe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from your feminine good fellowes, and that is, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſing any amorous ſongs; yet ſheele take tobacco &amp; breake the pipes, drinke wine and breake the glaſſes, and roare as well as any ſinging Syren, and on a pipe, (if ſhe get it in her mouth) ſhe will perfectly expreſſe the tune of

               <p>She is unconſtant, and will leap from place to place, as the Browniſt doth from point to point in his Sermons, and it may be ſuppoſed that ſhe learnt her giddy actions from her halfe couſins, which are Baboons.

Her dyet is <hi>a le mode de France,</hi> that is, after the French faſhion, for ſhe loves kick-ſhaws, and dairty novelties, and hath a conſtant appetite to delectable things, as if her mouth were made onely for a Lenton mill to grind figs, almonds, and raiſens, and it is doubtfull whether La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies inſtructed her, or ſhe taught them to waſte time in devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſugar-plums and ſweet-meats, for ſhe will eate more then a pariſh Mid-wife. And becauſe ſhe is a Court Delinquent, and ready to play ſhrewd turnes there, if ſhe be not prevented; ſhe is therefore tyed to the nave of a wheele, which ſhe rowls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his Fate before him, pillaging and plundring where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he comes.</p>
               <p>And now we talk of plundering, this Monkey is by nature a notable plunderer, for if ſhe were put into a Study of Claſſicall Authors or into one of the ſhops in <hi>Pauls</hi>-Churchyard, do you think ſhe would reade any of the Books? No, but in the Study ſhe would teare and rend all the papers and letters that ſhee could find, and all the books, then ſhe would ſpill the ink up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the table, and poure out all the ſand-duſt. If Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> ſhould but let her raiſe an Army of Monkeys, or tranſport them hither by ſhipping from beyond Sea, it is thought that this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key with an Army of Malignant Monkeys would come and
<pb facs="tcp:123812:4"/> plunder all the Coſter-mongers houſes in London, and all the Fruiterers ſtalls; and moreover, ſhe and her Forces would plunder all the Ladies cloſets, and make vile worke amongſt their ſweet-meats; but yet ſhe would be more merciful then Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> for ſhe would take away no gold or ſilver, but nuts, cakes, apples, ginger-bread, and the like, ſhould be all her pillage, which ſhe would ſeize upon. Beſides all theſe tricks, ſhe is a cunning jugler, for ſhe can caſt a miſt before ſoldiers eyes, ſo that when they think they have gotten their pay in their own hands, if they do but open their hands, they ſhall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them but a ruſty musket or a pike. Morever, if ſhe ſhould come into a Church, if ſhe did but breathe or blow upon a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-book, and afterward bid a Browniſt open it, he would ſweare that all the leaves were ful of nothing but Croſſes, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Beads, Surplices, Hoods, Coaps, and all kind of Popiſh Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. It is thought that ſhe made the <hi>Adamites</hi> walk na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſo that the holy ſiſters thought it a divine innocence to ſhew their Monkeys to their zealous brethren. The Family of love had the ſame zeale to monkifie themſelves, and through the provocation of the ſpirit (which they called holy zeal) they became as luſtfull as monkeys, and none muſt be admitted into their conventicles, but the monkified brethren and ſiſters of the family. Thus P. <hi>Ruperts</hi> Monkey is a kind of old, little, wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, old faced, petulant, wanton, and malignant gentlewoman, the little whore of Babylon in a green coat, that ſomtimes rides upon the beaſt that is Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> dog, that tempts the Prince by her laſcivious geſtures, to think oftner on a woman then he would do, though I beleeve he dare ſtand for the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine cauſe, and hath plundered ſome Ladies cabynits as wel as Countrey towns. She is indeed a skin-ful of folly, a malignant ancient gentlewoman, a Cavalier-monkey, a jugler, that hath turned the Univerſity-caps to Court-feathers. It is fit therefore ſhe ſhould be delivered up, and baited to death this Lent, before the well-affected brethren; who without doubt wil grant this to be a conſiderable motion concerning Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> malignant Monkey:
